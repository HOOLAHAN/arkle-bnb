# MakersBnB Project Seed

This repo contains the seed codebase for the MakersBnB project in Ruby (using Sinatra and RSpec).

Someone in your team should fork this seed repo to their Github account. Everyone in the team should then clone this fork to their local machine to work on it.

## Setup

```bash
# Install gems
bundle install

# Run the tests
rspec

# Run the server (better to do this in a separate terminal).
rackup
```

We are team Arkle

Bearing in mind the EQ learning weâ€™ve done with Dana and elsewhere, we want to foster a good team to work in

(Hint: this may help) 

We plan to meet
At 10am for morning standup
At 2pm for afternoon standup
At 4.30pm for a retro at the end of the day

We value:
Honesty
Compassion
 learning
(in that order)

We will have a nominated leader/spokesperson which will rotate daily
Robin Mon
Joe Tues
Iain Weds
Will Thurs
FRI TBC (pen to decide)

When we are upset we will raise it immediately in the Slack channel, separating the facts and the story as far as we are able, and giving actionable, specific and kind feedback as appropriate
